Design Patterns 


SRP SOC Single Resposibility 



Singleton 
singleton seems cool too but not sure if every design patterns requiers 
borg patterns: 
    involes the use of moonstate specific class 



Composite: 
seems like a good way to work with json files since thats like adding 
a series of leaves onto a tree and adding some changes to it 

Flyweight 
seems like a good way to reduce data stored in db.. but does increase 
complexting 

Parse 
this feels like somethign i would need for latex understand 
and just good coding and other than that doesnt really be used much 

decorator 
This is og i guess a lot could be implemented using this than manuelly editing them 

chain of command
this feels like when we take a single json and have multiple chain of functions 
acting over it this would be usefuel in that (have to test this theory)
